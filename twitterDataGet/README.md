getTopsyTwitter.py
------------------
Author: @oscarmarinmiro

Tool to get past tweets (up to beginning 2011) from a query from Topsy twitter index (www.topsy.com) along a date range [days, months..]

You can also get other media (photos, videos, etc...): It is conveived to pull data from a wide date range. In order to do so, you must get a TOPSY API Key at http://manage.topsy.com/ . They have a 30 day free trial with up to 7000 queries/day (which is a lot, BTW)

Please respect Topsy capacity w/ the included 'SLEEP' constants
